## About
Scan your products with a camera and add them to your Grocy in one click.
It attempts to find an existing product with the barcode or will search and create one automatically if Grocy does not know this product yet.
This only works with Products that have a barcode and are available on one of the providers.

This is heavily inspired from [barcodebuddy](https://github.com/Forceu/barcodebuddy).
However, instead of prompting you to create the product, it will create the product itself.
